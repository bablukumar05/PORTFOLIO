## âš¡ About React + Vite

This project is built with **React + Vite**.

Vite provides a minimal setup to get React working with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and ESLint integration.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) â†’ uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) â†’ uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
